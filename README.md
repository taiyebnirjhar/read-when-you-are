## ✨ Inspiration

![Inspiration](./inspiration-screenshot.png)

Saw This Facebook product ads: a physical jar filled with colorful paper slips. Each slip held a comforting verse from the Quran. The jar said:
**"Read when you are... lost, sad, lonely..."**
Each emotion was tied to a color—prompting you to pick a matching note.

That real-world moment sparked a thought:
**Why can't this be a calming, accessible web app for everyone?**

## 🌈 The Experience

This web app is a digital reimagination of that jar. Simple, soothing, and impactful.

- **Landing Section**:
  _"Read when you are..."_ → Followed by colored emotion buttons like **Sad**, **Lonely**, **Happy**, etc.

- **Color-Coded Emotion Buttons**:
  Each button visually reflects the mood (e.g., yellow for happy, blue for sad).

- **Modal on Click**:
  Clicking an emotion opens a modal with:

  - A beautiful gradient background that matches the emotion
  - A hand-picked Quranic verse relevant to that feeling
  - The verse reference included for context and authenticity
